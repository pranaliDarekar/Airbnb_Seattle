The Prediction of Airbnb on a weekly basis to realize the price trend.
Airbnb is an online platform like a marketplace of accommodation which matches the needs of staying and of lending. 
It is used for short-term homestays. Airbnb acts as a broker and charges a commission from each booking they get. 
The regression algorithm is used to predict the weekly trend where the listing prices in the weekend are higher than weekdays. 
The project will give answers to the following questions: 
How long is the period available for lending by rooms? 
Is there a busy season? And so on.
